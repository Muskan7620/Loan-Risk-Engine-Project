Loan-Risk-Engine-Project(MYSQL)

This project simulates a loan risk analysis system using MySQL. It includes relational tables for customers, loans, repayments, and transactions. Using SQL queries, it identifies high-risk borrowers, delayed payments, and overall loan performance. The goal is to demonstrate how structured data and relational models can be used to support decision-making in financial institutions. This project showcases practical skills in database design, data querying, and financial risk assessment.
